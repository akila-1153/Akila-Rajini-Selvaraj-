Step 1: Download Dataset 1 — Of Genomes And Genetics dataset

            Download the Of Genomes And Genetics dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryarishabh/of-genomes-and-genetics-hackerearth-ml-challenge 

Step 2: Download Dataset 2 — Exome Sequencing (ES) dataset

            Download the Soilless farming dataset from the following link:  
            https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33502066/

Step 3: Download Dataset 3 — Monogenic Disorders (MOGEDO) dataset

            Download the Monogenic Disorders (MOGEDO) dataset from the following link:  
            https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888012/


Step 4: Open the Python Application  

            Navigate to the project folder named:  
            final_code  

Step 5: Open the Main Script  
 
            Open the file named:  
            code.py  

Step 6: Load the Dataset  

            When prompted:  
            - Enter the full path to the dataset file (e.g., a CSV file)  
            - Enter the name of the label column from the dataset  

Step 7: Run the Application  

            Execute the script to train and evaluate the model using the provided dataset.

Step 8: View the Output  

            After execution, the model will display the performance results such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall F1-Score  and Specificity.

Step 9: Repeat for All Datasets  

             Repeat Steps 4 to 9 for each of the three datasets to complete the full evaluation.
